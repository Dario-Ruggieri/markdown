# Dir in Linux

Why this article? I don't know. It is the first thing that I think, so let's see it.

## Create a dir

You can create a dir using the command _mkdir_
Let's do an example:

```
mkdir dir_name

```

## Delete a dir

You can delete a dir using the command _rm_
Let's do an example:

```
rm -r dir_name

```

The _-r_ parameter gives you the possibilities of removing a dir

## Enter in a dir

To enter in a dir you have to use the command _cd_

```
cd dir_name

```
